How to add a new word:
1. Choose what word you're running
2. Change guess in cheat.py to the word you want
3. Paste the output into cheat.txt (may take up to an hour to run; i = 0 will take the longest to run by far)
    Some words already have a file in Word_Data
4. OptiBot is ready to run :)
5. Optional: Run OptiBot Testing
